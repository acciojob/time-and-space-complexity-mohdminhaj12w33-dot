    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to analyze how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. It helps in determining whether an algorithm is efficient or not when dealing with large data sets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the size of the input.
